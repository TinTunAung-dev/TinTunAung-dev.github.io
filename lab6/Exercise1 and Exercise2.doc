Exercise 1: What’s the output in the console?
function b() {
    const y = 30;
    a();
    function a() {
        console.log(x, y);
    }
    var x = 10;
    console.log(x, y);
}
const x = 20;
var y = 40;
b();

Ans: The output for function a() is 'x is undefined and y is 30'. Because x is declared using var which is function scoped and hoisted to the global and it is assigned a value after the function a() is called. At that time, x is still in TDZ and the value 'undefined'.
The output for function b() is 'x is 10 and y is 30'.

Exercise 2: What’s the output in the console?
function foo(x) {
    let m;
    console.log(x, y);
    if (x > 5) {
        var y = 5;
        m = x + y;
    } else {
        let z = 10;
        m = z;
    }
    x = m;
    console.log(x, y);
}
var x = 10;
foo(3);
console.log(x);

Ans: The output of the first console.log is 'x is 3 and y is undefined'. 
The output of the second console.log is 'x is 10 and y is still undefined' because of if statement is not called.
The output of the third console.log is 'x is 10'.
